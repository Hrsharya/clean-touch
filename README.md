# clean-touch
Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework .
Clean Touch is an innovative, high-tech waste management ecosystem designed to streamline community cleanliness through real-time collaboration between citizens, service workers, and administrators. It replaces manual reporting with a transparent, "live" digital workflow that ensures accountability and rapid response.1. The Core User RolesThe project utilizes a three-tier user architecture to manage the waste lifecycle:Citizens (Public): Users can report waste by uploading photos through a sleek, "Crystal-glass" mobile interface. The app automatically captures the geo-location to pinpoint the issue.Service Workers (Cleaners): Workers receive localized "hotspot" notifications. Once they clean an area, they must upload a verified, geo-tagged "after" photo to close the task.Administrators: A high-level command center allows officials to track work progress, monitor worker efficiency, and view real-time analytics of resolved vs. pending issues.2. Technical StackThe project is built using a modern, scalable professional stack:Frontend: Developed with React Native and Vite, featuring a sophisticated "biophilic" UI theme of Navy, Emerald Green, and Crystal.Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express, utilizing the Antigravity framework for high-performance agentic development.Database: Uses PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, with the PostGIS extension to handle complex geographic and spatial data.ORM: Prisma is used to manage type-safe database migrations and queries.3. Key Interactive FeaturesLive Status Tracking: Real-time progress bars and status updates (Pending $\rightarrow$ In-Progress $\rightarrow$ Resolved).Geo-Fencing: Logic that ensures workers only see tasks within their assigned jurisdiction or radius.Audit Transparency: A digital paper trail in the AuditLog table that records exactly who cleaned what and when.
